            <h2>Random Mouse Search</h2>
            <p>A random search algorithm refers to an algorithm that uses some kind of randomness or probability (typically in the form of a pseudo-random number generator) in the defi- nition of the method, and in the literature, may be called a Monte Carlo method or a stochastic algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Depth First Search</h2>
            <p>Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</p>

            <h2>Breadth First Search</h2>
            <p>an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.</p>
